# EnigmaShield

This project implements a robust encryption framework that combines multiple ciphers to enhance data security. The combination includes the Hill Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Polygram Substitution Cipher, and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).

## Features
- **Hill Cipher:** A classical symmetric-key algorithm for encryption.
- **Playfair Cipher:** A digraph substitution cipher for encrypting pairs of letters.
- **Polygram Substitution Cipher:** A substitution cipher that replaces predefined polygrams with corresponding ciphertext.
- **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):** A mode of operation that adds a layer of chaining to enhance security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library (install using `pip install numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:leonTech254/EnigmaShield.git
